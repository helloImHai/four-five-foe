# Four Five Foe

## Introduction

This is the frontend-repo for Four Five Foe. This was a game I used to play a lot in secondary school. It's like tic-tac-toe but there are a lot more boxes and you win when you get 5 in a row (or 4 open).

Play the game [here](https://helloimhai.github.io/four-five-foe)

## Some comments about the Repository

Purposely made it public for anyone who wants to build something like this. I'm pretty sure there are some anti patterns as I'm still a noob but there are some that can find this helpful in getting started with React and creating a real-time application.

Communication between frontend and backend is done with Socket.io, I think most of the magic and logic is in the backend, you can find it [here](https://github.com/helloImHai/backboard).

## Deployment reminders for Hai

```
# Make changes in main repo
git push

^ Really simple but I'm pretty sure I'll forget in a few months.
